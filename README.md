### Project Overview
---                                                          
Steve, graduated in fall of 2021, with a bachelor’s degree in finance. Following the 
virtual ceremony, his parents sat him down for a chat. Socially, his parents live a “green” lifestyle, and in their social spheres they actively promote alternative energy (ATM: solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, tidal, biomass and hydrogen). Comfortable now, Mom and Dad conveyed spirited intentions on expanding their support, economically. 

An intriguing new venture; a challenge such as this one entails risk - requiring collaborative effort, and prospective investment to counter. Luckily, the projects timing fittingly coincided with the fruition of Steve’s 4-year-long academic pursuit - attaining financial prowess, and acumen. In a gesture of good-faith, Mom and Dad - as his inaugural clients – decided to employ Steve. 

His new clients had initially  decided to invest all their money into, Daqo New Energy Corp. DQ (NYSE) - a manufacturer of silicon wafers, designed for solar panels. Steve’s first assignment: to implement an actionable, value-driven investment strategy in support of his client’s investment interests in alternative energy(any energy source that does not use fossil fuels - coal, gasoline and natural gas). In turn, Steve pulled, and wrangled sets of DQ stock data compared to other companies - using Excel to organize the data, and perform analysis; however, Steve needed help, and commissioned this project to explore alternative energy stock performance by analyzing financial data using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications).

### Deconstructing the Objective 

One way to perform this data analysis would be to go through all of Steve's stock data manually and use Excel formulas for calculations. But with Visual Basic for Applications, which is typically referred to as "VBA," we can write code that will automate these analyses for us. Often used in the finance industry, VBA provides essentially infinite extensibility to Excel. Using code to automate tasks decreases the chance of errors and reduces the time needed to run analyses, especially if they need to be done repeatedly. 

### Programmatically Analyzing the Data
